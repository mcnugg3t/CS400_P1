Steps to clone to your machine and commit:

1. Create github account at https://github.com/ 
2. In your terminal, navigate to the directory on your machine where you want to store our project work, then run: git clone https://github.com/mcnugg3t/CS400_P1.git
3. I’ve already made branches for each of us to work in, based on our role names. Please do not make any changes in main - it’s not the end of the world if you do, since we can revert back, but it will make extra work for us as a group.
4. Note that the git repo includes a .gitignore file already configured for java, so when you’re ready to commit the files in your branch, you can run:
  $ git branch (to check you’re in the correct branch - should be your role name) 
  $ git commit -am “descriptive message goes here” (adds and commits everything in your local repo)
  $ git push -u origin YourBranchName (pushes your changes to the shared repo stored on github.com)
